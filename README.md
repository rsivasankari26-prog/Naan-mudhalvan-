# Naan Mudhalvan – Admin Dashboard Using React.js and Node.js

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan Program**. The goal of this project is to design and implement a **modern Admin Dashboard** that allows users to manage, visualize, and analyze data in an efficient way. The dashboard is built using **React.js for the frontend** and **Node.js for the backend**, providing a dynamic, interactive, and responsive web application.

The dashboard integrates real-time data visualization using **Chart.js / Recharts** and displays key metrics through various types of charts like bar, line, and pie graphs. It provides a simple yet powerful interface for administrators to track and manage activities effectively.

## 🧩 Output Description
The **Admin Dashboard Output** demonstrates an organized layout containing multiple sections such as user management, sales overview, and performance analytics.  
Each section uses **charts** (bar, line, and pie) to display visual summaries of the data.  

### Example of Output:
- **User Statistics Chart** – shows the number of active, new, and returning users.  
- **Sales Analysis Chart** – represents monthly sales performance.  
- **Performance Graph** – highlights key metrics and trends.  

The **output folder** in this repository contains screenshots and exported reports (`output/`) that visually represent the final working dashboard.
